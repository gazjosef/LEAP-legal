# LEAP Legal

## Activity One

Name one app or website you use but never enjoy the experience.

What are the main issues with it and what would you do to improve it?
What is your process when creating a new web page or web app?

## Activity Two

Create a page referencing the design files provided (XD link and attachments) trying to match it as closely as possible. Ensure the code is clean, functions as expected, and avoid CSS frameworks and UI kits - CSS processors are welcome though.

You can use Vanilla JavaScript or a modern framework of your choice (e.g. NuxtJS) but also avoid libraries for simple components and tasks. Use CodeSandbox or any other similar tool which allows easy access to code and interface for review.
